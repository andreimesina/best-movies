# best-movies

My team and I created this project as a result of attending the Software Development Techniques lab at the university.  

## Overview
This project could be used mainly as a tool for somebody that wants to create and maintain a database of his/her favourite movies, actors and/or production companies.

## Technical Details
This project contains two main parts:
1. [API](https://github.com/andreimesina/best-movies/tree/master/API)
2. [Web Application that consumes the API](https://github.com/andreimesina/best-movies/tree/master/Web%20Application)

We have created the API using C#.NET following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and using Entity Framework as the database framework.

The Web Application is using NodeJS with Angular.
